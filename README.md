# Fake News Classification and Bidirectional LSTM-RNN

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of deep learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The primary focus is on Fake News Classification using LSTMs and a Bidirectional LSTM-RNN model.

## Files
- **`FakeNewsClassifierUsingLSTM.ipynb`** – A notebook implementing an LSTM-based classifier for detecting fake news.
- **`Bidirectional_LSSTM_RNN.ipynb`** – A notebook that builds and trains a Bidirectional LSTM-RNN model for text processing tasks.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebooks:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib nltk
